# Pixelfyer
A collection of tools used for [Asteroid Odyssey](https://github.com/Maxi13421/Spaceshooter) to generate tilemaps from real celestial bodies, recolor them in your own color palettes, and more.
For a given number of colors, it can approximates the list of colors that minimizes the mean squared distance between the color in the picture and a color of the list in the CIELAB color space. 
That list can be used afterwards to map every color of the list to one of your own color palette.
